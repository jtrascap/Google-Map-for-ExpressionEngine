Version 2.5
-----------
Version 2.x has officially come to a close. I am only leaving it available for those that need a free solution. This version will not be officially supported. Everyone is encouraged to upgrade to v3. I put A LOT of time and hard work into v3 and is something I am extremely proud of. Thanks for everyone who supported this add-on, and I hope you continue to support v3.

I also updated the download package with the original documentation and examples, as they are no longer available online.

Version 2.4 12/28/2011
----------------------
Merged a pull request, bug fixes, and deleted all the code for advanced features rendering this the "free" version of Google Maps for ExpressionEngine. All features in the previous v2.3 beta have been merged into the v3 release. Commercial release is coming soon with all new advanced features and a complete rewrite of the code based.


Version 2.3 BETA Build 7/20/2011
--------------------------------
Added basic form validation using CodeIngiter's validation class. Added the ability to geocode multiple locations. Fixed a bug that caused errors and notices when an invalid location was thrown at the geocoded.

Version 2.3 BETA Build 7/11/2011
--------------------------------
Fixed the bug that caused the map to clip when it was hidden before initialization (for the fieldtype).

Version 2.3 BETA Build 7/07/2011
--------------------------------
A number of bug fixes for the search and results methods.


Version 2.3 BETA Build 6/22/2011
--------------------------------
A number a significant improvements have been made to more easily search your channel data in relation to a specific location. Currently the user can only define the location, not the developer. However, this will not be the case in future builds. A new result method tracks the search search results that also integrates well with the channel:entries tag. Much more to come in this release. (This is the first BETA build of 2.3)

Version 2.2.1 Build 6/13/2011
-----------------------
Minor bug fixes that dealt with the field type and safecracker that caused some installations no to update the lat and lng. Also fixed the long time bug that caused conditional statements no to process correctly inside javascript. (Now $config['protect_javascript'] = 'n';)

Version 2.2 Build 6/10/2011
----------------------
Version 2.2 brings a load of new features to the table. Here are the major ones:

Create maps with custom marker icons
Create maps with custom styles using the Google Maps API Styles Map Wizard
5 all new methods for further extendability including: gmap:marker, gmap:dropdown, gmap:center, gmap:zoom, and gmap:init.
Fully compatible with Matrix (with SafeCracker coming before the final release)
Display one info window at a time
Add control over the default zoom functionality
New gmap:dropdown method can be used to auto-populate a dropdown menu with the markers on the map.
All new fieldtype with a very simple drag and drop interface to geocode a matrix of coordinates.
Limit number of markers that can be added to the fieldtype.
Populate custom latitude and longitude fields with the individual degrees.
Available in 5 languages: English, French, Dutch, Norwegian, and Spanish
Compatibility with SafeCracker, NSM Add-on Updater, and the new @ee_zoo's new Visitor


Version 2.1.3 Build 5/9/2011
----------------------
Added the ability to search custom fields like the inherent exp:channel:entries tag. (search:custom_field="some value").


Version 2.1.2 Build 5/9/2011
----------------------
Fixed the a problem the with double-quotes breaking the javascript. The markup that is now inserted into the info window is now escaped.


Version 2.1.1 Build 5/5/2011
----------------------
Fixed a typo the caused a JavaScript error in IE that resulted in the maps not displaying properly.


Version 2.1 Build 5/2/2011
----------------------
Core plugin code was completely rewritten for comprehension and for easier long-term support. The original API was unchanged, except with the addition of several new features. Added latitude_field, longitude_field, and zoom_field to pull the respective values from a specified channel. Plot or center on a static longitude and latitude coordinate. Now able to add multiple static addresses. The only required field is now the id. A lot of rules were changes in how data interacts with the map. If the address or coordinates are blank coming from the channel, the record is ignored. You can define a single channel that stores address and coordinates and plot them on a single map. The idea of the upgrade was to be less restrictive.


Version 2.0 Build 4/23/2011
----------------------
Completely revamped the Google Map implementation within the native channel:entries tag instead of using a proprietary syntax. Google Maps v3.0 API was used instead of 2.0 which comes with mobile support. All v3.0 options are available.
